 <h1>Students</h1>

Students in a mathematics class
A student is a person who goes to school and is learning something. Students can be children, teenagers, or adults who are going to school, but it may also be other people who are learning, such as in college or university. A younger student is often called a pupil. Usually, students will learn from a teacher or a lecturer if at university. They also do much reading. A student can also be a person studying for a specific profession. Where the teaching is called "training" the student may be called a "trainee". <br>
<br>
There is always a conflict between “what is” and “What should be”. Many times People are satisfied and carried away with “what is” than exploring the beauty of “what should be”. <br>
Many would answer this question with “What is” student life. <br>
The age of a student life is ideal time to grasp new things. So, it is time to learn <br>
Student life is filled with joy since they have no responsibilities on their shoulders and since the days are not going to be back once they take up the responsibilities they should make use of it to the maximum. <br>
Student life is the time where they start making friends and find the true friends of their lifetime friends. <br>
<br>
<br>
efore now, no one was so much worried our marks. Now, out of the blue , there's everyone talking about our future , engineering or medical , this and that. Now, the student starts to feel the pressure building up. Then , there are the tenth boards. <br> Everyone starts studying much harder than they used to. But , some of us fail to score a 95% and the rest of the community starts to judge us and compare us with other students. <br> Some long distant relative starts to give us career advices . But there are photographers / musicians / artists / actors who just want to pursue their passion, <br> their dream . But , since we are in India , our parents say ,“ will doing these things provide you with food ? ”. <br> Amidst all this , we now have to join a coaching institute because if we don't crack JEE , then it is impossible to us to get a job <br> (what most of the parents think). But people miss is what the real potential of the child was . <br>
You study for 10th boards , everyone says : “ study for now , then of course you can enjoy” <br>
You study for 12th boards again everyone says :“study for now, then have fun in the college” <br>
When you are in the college: “ Just get a real good job and then it's just fun for you”. <br>
